MATLAB Implementation of the Revised Simplex Method for Linear Programming

Hello! If you are here, you are viewing my MATLAB implementation of the Revised Simplex Method. The Revised Simplex Algorithm is a linear programming technique that solves a linear program in Standard Computational Form if you are not already aware of this. It achieves this through performing two phases. 

If we don't have a leaving variable at any point, then the problem is unbounded (so no clear-cut solution to the problem), and it terminates accordingly. If our objective function value is not 0 upon Phase One's conclusion, then our problem is infeasible, and our program thus concludes.
